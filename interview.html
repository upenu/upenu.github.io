      <p>Each mock technical interview <b>lasts 30 minutes at the UPE Office at 346 Soda Hall</b>. They are hosted by either an officer or one of our Professional Development committee members. Interviews are primarily whiteboard coding interviews, but we can accommodate other formats by request. We also provide post-interview critique on how to do better the next time around. </p>
