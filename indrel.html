faq:
  - title: When and where are infosessions held?
    answer: On a case-by-case basis, we will secure a space appropriate for both the expected turnout and the nature of the event—typically, this will be the Wozniak Lounge, Sibley Auditorium, or HP Auditorium. Event setup usually occurs at around 5PM, and the doors open at 6PM. The space is usually reserved for 2 hours.
  - title: How is the event publicized?
    answer: We use 1) our internal Slack channels, 2) Facebook events, 3) newsletters, and 4) flyers to publicize events to both our honor society members and the general computer science community.
  - title: What is the student turnout for the event?
    answer: This really is dependent on the company, the speaker, and the time of year. If you would like an estimate of the projected attendance for your event, please contact us via email.
  - title: How are events for CAP and non-CAP companies different?
    answer: You do not have to be a CAP member to hold an event with UPE and the CS community at Cal, but without the membership, you may not actively recruit and collect resumes at the event. 
  - title: How much does an event cost?
    answer: If you are a CAP member, you are allowed to host 1 infosession per semester with the EECS department. If you would like to host more events, we can help setup additional, non-recruiting events to either the general public or just our members for $1000 each.
  - title: Can our event be co-sponsored?
    answer: We have planned events with other organizers in the past and wouldn’t be opposed to do it again in the future, but we would prefer to be the sole student partner. This helps us maintain consistent communication and maximize reliability.
  - title: Have you worked with startups before?
    answer: Yes! Our past events with startups have been quite well received. This is because startups are usually able to send speakers who know a great deal about the company from a broader perspective. They bring a wealth of knowledge that students crave, and it always creates a fun give-and-take environment.
  - title: How do I host an event with UPE?
    answer: Please email us at <i>ir (at) upe.berkeley.edu</i> as soon as possible if you would like us to help host an event for you at Cal. Ideally, you should contact us 4+ weeks prior to the date on which you want to have the event. This is because we have to book rooms, and the closer to the date, the harder it is to book a room with enough capacity for the event.
